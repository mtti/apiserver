Library for implementing RESTful JSON APIs with Node.js according to the author's personal preferences. Implemented in TypeScript and intended to be usable from plain JavaScript.

## Goals

* Easily create RESTful JSON CRUD APIs by implementing a standard document store interface (repository pattern) and a few access control hooks.
* JSON:API v1.0 compliance
* TypeScript is recommended, but can be used from JavaScript as well.
* Runnable in AWS Lambda.
